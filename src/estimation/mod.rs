//! # spod estimation
//!
//! ## Scientific scope
//!
//! This crate collects the numerical estimation kernels used by the POD
//! workspace: batch weighted least squares, nonlinear Gauss-Newton
//! iteration, and a sequential Kalman-style update path. The scientific
//! target is short-arc orbit determination where measurement models and
//! force models are supplied by neighboring crates.
//!
//! These routines assume callers provide already-linearized residual rows
//! or propagation closures at the appropriate orbit-determination epoch.
//! They do not introduce their own measurement corrections, force laws, or
//! time-scale conversions.
//!
//! ## Technical scope
//!
//! The crate re-exports `gauss_newton`, `NormalEquations`, `OrbitEkf`, and the
//! parameter descriptors that define estimator-state ordering. Public APIs
//! mainly consume scalar residuals, Jacobians, and covariance-like matrices
//! in solver space, while typed orbital and temporal quantities remain
//! owned by `siderust` and the observation/service crates.
//!
//! This module is the numerical core only: file formats, synthetic data
//! generation, and product writing are intentionally delegated to sibling
//! crates.
