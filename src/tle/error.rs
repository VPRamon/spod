//! Unified error taxonomy for `siderust-tle`.
//!
//! The crate exposes exactly one error enum, [`TleError`], covering every
//! parser branch (classic 2LE/3LE, OMM-KVN, OMM-XML, OMM-JSON) as well as
//! programmatic-construction failures from [`crate::TleBuilder`].

/// Errors produced by every parser, writer and builder in `siderust-tle`.
///
/// All public APIs return `Result<_, TleError>`; the crate never depends on
/// `anyhow`. Variants are deliberately structural so callers can react
/// programmatically (e.g. tolerate `BadChecksum` while rejecting `BadLength`).
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use spod::tle::{parse_tle, TleError};
///
/// let too_short = "1 25544";
/// let other     = "2 25544";
/// match parse_tle(too_short, other) {
///     Err(TleError::BadLength { line, .. }) => assert_eq!(line, 1),
///     other => panic!("unexpected: {other:?}"),
/// }
/// ```
