//! Unified error enum for `spod::dynamics`.
//!
//! Wraps the failure surfaces this crate exposes:
//!
//! * Upstream [`crate::dynamics::DynamicsError`] for any integrator,
//!   variational, or force-model failure surfaced through the typed adapter.
//! * Registry / configuration validation errors raised by
//!   [`crate::dynamics::registry::ForceModelRegistry`] and friends.
//! * Process-noise input validation.
//! * Explicit *feature-not-implemented* signal for stubs that the registry
//!   recognises by name but cannot yet build (e.g. boxwing SRP).
//!
//! No `anyhow` is used; every variant is an explicit case so consumers can
//! pattern-match.
